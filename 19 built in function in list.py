#lets see the some of built in functions for list
j = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

#first we see the length function which calculate the length of elements
# len(List name)
print (len(j))

#sum() function calculate the sum of all elements in the list
print(sum(j))

#min() function give the minimum value of all elements
print(min(j))

#max () function give the maximum value of all elements
print(max(j))

# if we want to know avarage of the all elements in the list lets try this
print (sum(j)/len(j))
